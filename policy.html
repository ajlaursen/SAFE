				<h5>FERPA (1974)</h5>
				<p>
					Under FERPA, institutions may not disclose personally
					identifiable information (PII) contained in education
					records without the student’s written consent except under
					certain conditions (see below). FERPA’s privacy protections
					apply to undocumented students in the same way as other
					domestic students (FERPA)

				<h5>1976: MCL 380.1135(1)</h5>
				<p>
					Michigan law that revised school of code to make sure that
					students who want to enroll who may not have a birth
					certificate still can enroll in school. This comes with
					providing proof of age and an explanation as to why there
					isn’t a birth certificate. (Michigan)

				<h5>Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982)</h5>
				<p>
					1982 court case that involved the US Supreme Court striking
					down a Texas state statute that denied funding for education
					of undocumented immigrant children (Court)
					<br /><br />
					The Court reasoned that illegal aliens and their children,
					though not citizens of the United States or Texas, are
					people "in any ordinary sense of the term" and, therefore,
					are afforded Fourteenth Amendment protections. (Plyler)
					<br /><br />
					Opponents argued that the law was intended to prevent an
					influx of illegal immigrants into Texas, to alleviate the
					burdens on the educational system caused by educating
					undocumented aliens, and to alleviate the burdens created by
					educating children who are unlikely to remain in the state
					and contribute to it. (Plyler v. Doe, 457)

					H.R.2202 - Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility
					Act of 1996
				</h5>
				<p>
					Prohibits means-tested public benefits, with specified
					exceptions, to an alien who is not a permanent resident, a
					refugee, a parolee, an asylee, an alien under withheld
					deportation, or a battered individual. Examples include: no
					access to in-state tuition (H.R.2202)
					<br /><br />
					Also amended the Immigration and Nationality Act-Prohibits
					foreign student status for an alien in a public elementary
					school or a publicly funded adult education program.

				<h5>DACA (2012)</h5>
				<p>
					The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was created to protect eligible young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and to provide them with work authorization for temporary, renewable periods.  As of December 31, 2022, there were roughly 580,000 active DACA recipients from close to 200 different countries of birth residing all over the U.S. (Published: Apr 13, 2023)

				<h5>DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act)
				</h5>
				<p>
					The goal of the DREAM Act is to provide current, former, and future undocumented high-school graduates and GED recipients a pathway to U.S. citizenship through college, work, or the armed services.  Unlike DACA, it gives undocumented immigrants a pathway to lawful permanent residency.  And they could satisfy this requirement by Higher education: “the person has acquired a degree from an institution of higher education or has completed at least two years, in good standing, in a program for a bachelor’s degree or higher degree in the United States.”  As of today the bill has failed to become law.  It most recently passed in the House as of 2010. (The DREAM act)
