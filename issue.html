				<h5>Background and overview</h5>
				<p>
					Undocumented young people encounter significant obstacles,
					including a scarcity of social, legal, financial, and
					emotional support. Their limited opportunities force them to
					exert more effort than their peers to succeed. While the
					federal government does not forbid states from offering
					federal financial aid to individuals who are not U.S. legal
					citizens, each state varies in its approach to Undocumented
					Students Seeking Higher Education. This includes differences
					in policies related to enrollment, tuition, and financial
					assistance. Undocumented students are barred from accessing
					federal financial aid, which encompasses work-study
					programs, loans, scholarships, and grants, leaving them to
					finance their education independently. Most scholarships
					require a Social Security number, leaving undocumented
					students to rely on private scholarships that do not have
					this requirement. The primary barrier to their education is
					financial constraints. In addition to their educational
					expenses, many undocumented students also need to
					financially support their families or relatives back in
					their home countries. Often, their parents face financial
					difficulties and urge them to join the workforce as soon as
					possible to contribute to the family's income.
				</p>

				<h5>Beyond Higher Education</h5>
				<p>
					After completing their education, undocumented students face
					the challenge of being unable to legally work in the United
					States. Without access to federal financial aid, their
					employment options are limited, as most jobs require a
					Social Security number. The jobs available to them are
					typically either illegal or low-paying. Discrimination
					further hinders undocumented students from pursuing higher
					education. Many conceal their immigration status due to
					deportation fears, which prevents schools from recognizing
					and assisting them. The combination of lack of family
					support and stringent immigration laws not only diminishes
					their opportunities to work legally in the U.S. but also
					contributes to feelings of despair.

				<h5>Overview: State of Michigan</h5>
				<p>
					In Michigan, certain public colleges and universities offer
					in-state tuition rates to qualified undocumented residents,
					including those under the DACA program. Michigan lacks a
					uniform state policy that grants undocumented students
					across the state the right to pay in-state tuition rates or
					state financial aid. However, individual public universities
					and community colleges, including the University of
					Michigan, have used their independent governance to set
					policies that allow undocumented students and those under
					DACA to qualify for in-state tuition. For example, the Board
					of Regents at Eastern Michigan University has implemented a
					tuition equity policy ensuring undergraduate students,
					whether they are from within the state, out-of-state, or
					from another country, including undocumented, DACA
					recipients, and refugees, are charged the same tuition
					rates. While some institutions might not have formal
					policies, they may still offer in-state tuition rates to
					undocumented students through more informal practices.
					Regarding refugee students, Michigan does not have specific
					statewide policies to facilitate their access to in-state
					tuition, and the availability of such benefits varies by
					educational institution.

				<h4>What is the Historical Context?</h4>
				<br />
				<h5>Landmark Ruling</h5>
				<p>
					The 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe is a landmark ruling that prohibits states from denying free public education to students based on their immigration status. This decision, grounded in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that all students, including undocumented ones, have the right to education from kindergarten through the 12th grade without discrimination. Currently, the United States is home to an estimated 11.3 million undocumented immigrants. Analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, using the United States Census Bureau data from 2012 to 2016, shows that about 8.63 million of these individuals come from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America.

				<h5>Current Statistics</h5>
				<p>
					Recent data from the 2021 American Community Survey reveals that there are over 408,000 undocumented students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities, accounting for 1.9% of the total college student population. This figure is down 4.2% from 2019, which saw 427,000 undocumented students enrolled. The decline is attributed to various factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic challenges, and legal issues surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Furthermore, the number of students either holding DACA status or eligible for it has decreased from 182,000 in 2019 to 141,000 in 2021, making up only one-third of undocumented college students and 0.7% of the overall college population. Interestingly, only 5% to 10% of undocumented students pursue higher education.

				<h5>
					Federal and State Laws
				</h5>
				<p>
					To address the rights of undocumented immigrants, including their access to higher education, federal laws such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the DREAM Act of 2001, and DACA in 2012 have been enacted. From 2001 to 2019, legislation in 19 states has been passed to allow undocumented students to enroll in higher education and qualify for in-state tuition rates. Additionally, seven of these states provide state-based financial aid to undocumented students.
