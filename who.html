						promoting tuition equality for all students, regardless
						of immigration status. They have been active in
						advocating for policies within the University of
						Michigan that would allow undocumented students to
						qualify for in-state tuition rates, making higher
						education more affordable.

				<h4>
					Organizations Against Access to Higher Education for Undocumented Immigrants
				</h4>
				<div class="who-section">
					<h5>
						Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)
					</h5>
					<p>
						FAIR argues that providing access to higher education for undocumented immigrants incentivizes illegal immigration and is unfair to legal residents and citizens.

				<div class="who-section">
					<h5>
						Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)
					</h5>
					<p>
						CIS often publishes research suggesting that the admission of undocumented immigrants to institutions like the University of Michigan places a burden on taxpayers and can lead to a reduction in resources for citizens and legal residents
